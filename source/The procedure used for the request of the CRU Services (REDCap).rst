	PM reviews the information in the completed survey.  If additional services are identified in the survey, the PM contacts the research team to set up a meeting.

	PM prepares a Project Definition based on the original survey and additional services determined to be necessary from a meeting if applicable. 

	The PM reviews the completed survey and project definition to create a Contract Agreement (Refer to CRU Contract Agreement).
